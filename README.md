# Real-Time Ad Placement & Performance Tracking Platform

## Problem Statement
Delivering personalized, relevant and engaging advertisements is critical for improving user experience and maximizing advertising revenue. However, managing ad placement and measuring ad performance in real-time can be a significant challenge, especially when dealing with dynamic user behavior, different content types, and varying ad formats.

Relying on systems that use batch processing for ad placement often leads to delays in optimizing campaigns based on user interaction data. Additionally, companies struggle with measuring ad effectiveness across multiple channels, devices, and content types, which makes it difficult to evaluate ROI and adjust campaigns promptly.

This project aims to build a scalable, real-time ad placement and performance tracking platform that integrates multiple data sources (e.g., user profiles, content metadata, ad catalogs) and streams data to enable real-time decision-making and better measurement of KPIs.

## Usefulness of the platform

1. **Increased Ad Revenue**:
By ensuring that ads are shown to the right audience at the right time, this platform can increase ad engagement and conversion rates, driving higher revenue for advertisers.

2. **Real-Time Optimization**:
With real-time performance tracking, advertisers can adjust campaigns on-the-fly, optimizing for metrics like CTR and Ad Completion Rate, which would be impossible to do with traditional batch processing. ey KPIs like Ad Relevance Score, CTR, and RPAI are directly tied to business objectives, helping companies understand how well their advertising strategies are working and where improvements are needed.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**:
By tracking detailed performance metrics, the platform empowers marketing teams and content creators to understand user preferences better and make data-backed decisions about future ad strategies and content offerings.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
The platform can handle large datasets and complex ad delivery systems, making it suitable for both small streaming and larger media platforms. The containerization approach ensures that it can be easily deployed in cloud-based environments, further enhancing scalability.
